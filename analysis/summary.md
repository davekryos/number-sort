## Recommendations

- **Increase solution depth**: 25 levels solve in <8 moves. Add more blocking or reduce empty tubes.
- **Increase fill ratio**: 32 levels have <65% fill. Add more pieces or reduce tube capacity.
- **Increase branching**: 48 levels have avg branching <2.0. More tubes or capacity variety helps.
- **Vary tube capacities**: 7 levels use uniform capacity. Mix sizes (3, 4, 5) for strategy.
- **Consider more tubes**: Most levels have <6 tubes. 5-6 tubes enables richer strategies.
- **Reorder levels**: 15 levels have computed difficulty far from their label. Consider reordering.
